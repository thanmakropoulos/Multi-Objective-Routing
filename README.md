# Multi-Objective-Routing
 Multi-Objective-Routing
 
 In this project, an implementation of a multi-objective routing approach is provided.
 Using overall routing time and dangerousness as the objectives, a routing estimation is depicted as a result of the algorithm. Through this approach, weight emphasis selection is supported and the results are corresponding to these selections, meaning that the user may define the percentage of each objective for the estimated routing.
 The algorithm could be executed up to a maximum of 4 times in order to reach the result.
