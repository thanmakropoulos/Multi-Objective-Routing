 Multi-Objective-Routing
 
 In this project, an implementation of a multi-objective routing approach is provided.
 Using the estimated routing time and the estimated dangerousness as objectives, routings are depicted on a map of the city of Paris. Through this approach, weight emphasis selection is supported, meaning that the user may define the weight percentage of each objective for the estimated routing. 
 The algorithm could be executed up to a maximum of 4 query levels achieving low overall execution time in constrast to other state of the art multi-objective optimization routing techniques.
